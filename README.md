# RabbitBlock
My own filterlist to fill in blanks that others may not. Feel free to use if you want. 

Disclaimer: this list **will most definitely break a lot of things.**

- What is in the scope of this project: blocking things that make sense to block that other lists commonly miss or don't block typically due to breakage reasons.
- What is **not** in the scope of this project: maintaining a massive filterlist. at least not right now i would need to learn how to deal with the burden of that first. massive by my standards is 30k+ rules. i may consider mirroring other lists in the future and use them to experiment but if i do they definitely won't be included in the default list as this list is intentionally meant to be as light as possible.

I may or may not update it. I have not decided yet. Either way at the time of me writing this don't expect consistent updates i don't have a lot of motivation at the moment.

Contributions or suggestions are very welcome.

To be clear this is a list for my own usecases. however be that as it may if it gets enough attention i could try to invest more of my time and attention to it.


Lists that work well with this one.

@Celenityy's [BadBlock](https://badblock.celenity.dev/)

I would highly recommend it if you are okay with the breakage it causes it is a very good and well done aggressive list.

@Hagezi's [Multi ultimate Blocklist](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists?tab=readme-ov-file#ultimate) 

It catches a lot of bad things and is frequently updated. a good general list that is low on breakage yet very effective. you can use the mini version if you are on a low resource device.

@ph00lt0's [Blocklist](https://github.com/ph00lt0/blocklist)

Like BadBlock this is a very well done list that isn't afraid to cause breakage. as such it fits in very well here.
