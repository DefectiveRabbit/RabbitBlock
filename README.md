# RabbitBlock
My own filterlist to fill in blanks that others may not. Feel free to use if you want. 

Disclaimer: this list will most definitely break a lot of things.

- What is in the scope of this project: blocking things that make sense to block that other lists commonly miss or don't block typically due to breakage reasons.
- What is **not** in the scope of this project: maintaining a massive filterlist. at least not right now i would need to learn how to deal with the burden of that first. massive by my standards is 30k+ rules. i may consider mirroring other lists in the future and use them to experiment but if i do they definitely won't be included in the default list as this list is intentionally meant to be as light as possible.

I may or may not update it. I have not decided yet. Either way at the time of me writing this don't expect consistent updates i don't have a lot of motivation at the moment.

Contributions or suggestions are very welcome.

To be clear this is a list for my own usecases. however be that as it may if it gets enough attention i could try to invest more of my time and attention to it.
